Okay now i wish to make this all to in AWS. The model prediction dashboard etc all the things. Wht are the services needed now and the generated data set should help to update the model BiLSTM. Like now the node-red data is stored in dynamodb with errors it should be compared with model and found errors and instead of errors the actuall correct value should be imputated on the fault area and stored in another dynamodb table and the. Initial table with fault dynamodb table shoul helps to train the model again and again for every 1-2 hrs. Like that. Give me the code, implementation and necessary things and what services should be used.
